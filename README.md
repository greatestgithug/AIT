PROBLEM TITLE: Make all negative in one end
AIM:
To write a program to arrange the positive and negative numbers such that all negative numbers appear before all positive numbers.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
Radhika has a basket of balls which are numbered with both positive and negative numbers in random order. She wants to rearrange the balls so that all negative number balls appear before all positive number balls with the order maintained. As she is busy with her homework, help her to complete the task. Write a program to implement the above task using array. Perform the basic operations includes creating an array, inserting an element in an array, displaying elements of array.

ALGORITHM:
Pass the given array to the function to rearrange the array elements.
Iterate through the array and find the negative element in the array and insert it within the array in the sequence of 0 to n-1 by shifting the positive element one position to the right.
If the encountered element is positive, then skip it and move on to the next element. 
The rearranged array is displayed on the console.

#include <stdio.h>
void rearrangePositiveNegativeElements(int arr[], int size){
int i, temp, j;
for(i = 1; i < size; i++){
temp = arr[i];

TASK NAME: Finding Duplicates
PROBLEM TITLE: Storing Student ID ensuring Data Uniqueness
AIM:
To write a program to find the duplicate entry of student Id using array concept.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
You are working on storing the student id in a database. There is a requirement to ensure that no duplicate entries of student id are allowed. Write a program to print all the duplicate student id that occurs more than once. Return the duplicate id in ascending order. If there is no duplicate id, then print -1.
INPUT FORMAT:
The first line represents number of students - n
Second line represents the list of Student Id - id 
OUTPUT FORMAT:
Print the student id removing the duplicates
CONSTRAINTS:
1 <= n <= 1000
1 <= nums <=2000

TEST CASE 3:

Output:

ALGORITHM:
We iterate through the array using two nested loops to compare each element with every other element in the array. 
If an element appears more than once, we insert it into the set. 
The repeating variable is used to keep track of whether an element has already been inserted into the set. 
Once a repeating element is found, we break out of the inner loop to avoid inserting it multiple times.

SOURCE CODE:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int* duplicates(int arr[], int n, int* result_size) {
    int* ans = NULL;

TEST CASE 3:
Input:

 1 9 12 
Output:
3
Explanation:
9 and 12 give the smallest difference of all possible pairs, which is 2.
ALGORITHM:
Declare and define the function `minDiffBruteForce` that takes an array `arr` and its size `n` as input.
Declare a variable `minDiff` and initialize it with the maximum possible value (`INT_MAX`).
Use nested loops to iterate over all pairs of elements in the array:
The outer loop runs from index 0 to index `n-2`.
The inner loop runs from the next index of the outer loop variable to index `n-1`.
Inside the inner loop:
Calculate the absolute difference between the elements at the current indices using the `abs()` function.
Update `minDiff` with the minimum of its current value and the calculated absolute difference.
After the loops, return the final value of `minDiff`.
In the `main()` function:
Declare an array `arr` and initialize it with values {3, -6, 7, -7, 0}.
Calculate the size of the array using the `sizeof` operator and divide it by the size of a single element `sizeof(arr[0])` to get the number of elements in the array.
Print the message "Minimum Difference is " followed by the result of `minDiffBruteForce(arr, n)` using the `printf` function.
SOURCE CODE:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int minDiffBruteForce(int arr[], int n) {
  int minDiff = INT_MAX;

  for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++)
    for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
      int absDiff = abs(arr[i] - arr[j]);
      minDiff = (absDiff < minDiff) ? absDiff : minDiff;

TASK NAME: Rotation
PROBLEM TITLE: Music Playlist Rotation
AIM:
To write a program to rotate the playlist by the given number of positions in a cyclic manner, ensuring that the songs are shifted and wrapped around appropriately.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
You are building a music player application, and one of the features you want to implement is the ability to rotate the order of songs in a playlist. The rotation operation allows the user to change the order of songs, giving a different listening experience without having to manually reorder the songs.
Implement a function that takes a playlist (an array of song titles) and the number of positions to rotate the playlist. The function should rotate the playlist by the given number of positions in a cyclic manner, ensuring that the songs are shifted and wrapped around appropriately.
INPUT FORMAT:
The first line represents number of songs : length
The second line represents an array of song list : arr
The third line represents the number of steps to rotate the playlist : k

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
Sort the nodes of the given singly linked list in ascending order
INPUT FORMAT:
The input line contains integers denoting elements of the given singly linked list.
 OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return the sorted list of elements that is provided in the input.

TEST CASE 2:

TEST CASE 3:

ALGORITHM:
 1. Create a class Node which has two attributes: data and next. Next is a pointer            
            to the next node in the list.
 2. Create another class SortList which has two attributes: head and tail.
 3. addNode() will add a new node to the list:
Create a new node.
It first checks, whether the head is equal to null which means the list is empty.
If the list is empty, both head and tail will point to a newly added node.
If the list is not empty, the new node will be added to end of the list such that tail's next will point to a newly added node. This new node will become the new tail of the list.
 4. sortList() will sort the nodes of the list in ascending order.
Define a node current which will point to head.
Define another node index which will point to node next to current.
Compare data of current and index node. If current's data is greater than the index's data then, swap the data between them.
Current will point to current.next and index will point to index.next.
Continue this process until the entire list is sorted.

 5. display() will display the nodes present in the list:
Define a node current which will initially point to the head of the list.
Traverse through the list till current points to null.
Display each node by making current to point to node next to it in each iteration.
SOURCE CODE:
